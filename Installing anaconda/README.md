Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, and Python distribution that contains a collection of many open source packages (numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, pandas to name a few). If you need additional packages after installing Anaconda, you can use Anaconda’s package manager, conda or pip to install those packages. This is highly advantageous as you don’t have to manage dependencies between multiple packages yourself. Conda even makes it easy to switch between Python 2 and 3 (you can learn more about it here). In fact, an installation of Anaconda is also a common way to install Jupyter Notebooks.

Step 1:-
Download ANACONDA.
Go to the Anaconda Website "https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution"

Step 6:-
This is an important part of the installation process. The recommended approach is to not check the first box to add Anaconda to your path. This means you will have to use Anaconda Navigator or the Anaconda Command Prompt (located in the Start Menu under “Anaconda”) when you wish to use Anaconda (you can always add Anaconda to your PATH later if you don’t check the box). If you want to be able to use Anaconda in your command prompt, please use the alternative approach and check both the boxes. Then click on Install.
