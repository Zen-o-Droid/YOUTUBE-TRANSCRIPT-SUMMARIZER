Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, and Python distribution that contains a collection of many open source packages (numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, pandas to name a few). If you need additional packages after installing Anaconda, you can use Anaconda’s package manager, conda or pip to install those packages. This is highly advantageous as you don’t have to manage dependencies between multiple packages yourself. Conda even makes it easy to switch between Python 2 and 3 (you can learn more about it here). In fact, an installation of Anaconda is also a common way to install Jupyter Notebooks.
