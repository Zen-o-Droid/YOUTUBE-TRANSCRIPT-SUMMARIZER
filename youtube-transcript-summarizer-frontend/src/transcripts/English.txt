So what azir did was they broke that content down into relevant parts and accordingly they had individual certifications so that people can focus on those and then move to the next certification and use the previous one as the stepping stone just like aws has done i mean they have their associate level certifications and then the advanced level now azure is working on similar parts and their reason for doing that is much better i mean what their reason gives them is one they get to divide the content into smaller parts and focus more on the specialized parts now if you talk about the new certifications easy100 it specifically focuses on administrative and infrastructure part then if you clear this certification you can move further and take the advanced level certification we'll be discussing about that as well but for now the main reason this transition has happened is it helped break the content down and the second was it introduced specialized approach i hope this is clear to you guys so let's move further and talk about something else. So what does this certification exactly cover guys as i've already mentioned it mostly focuses on the complete know-how of how azure works that is understandable and the second thing it does is it introduces you to azure's platform and focuses on infrastructure and deployment which specifically deals with administrative roles so it is understandable that this certification mostly covers everything that concerns an administrative role at least from azure certification point of view or microsoft azure certification point of view so guys what are some of the prerequisites now when i say prerequisites i would be talking about who are the candidates that can actually go ahead and appear for this examination we would understand what are the things that they should know what are the concepts they should know what experience should they have in all those things so let's just move further and talk about the prerequisites so who should take this examination   What not specific answers are required guys and you cannot actually just go back and forth once you are reading a passage do it completely answer the questions and then move further no going back in this particular case guys so take care of that standalone questions these are easier to appear make sure you manage your time well because you would want to appear all these questions for again guys um important point of think from the invis letters perspective or the moderator's perspective because what that means is you'd be prepared as in what is the moderator exactly trying to ask that is why this pointer is important attempt all the questions guys because no negative marking here and yes manage your time properly so guys if you take this approach you would be in a very good state to clear this particular certification examination when i say what approach you should take first and foremost you create a free tier account on microsoft azure and use the services get sufficient hands-on on the topics that you would want to take care of when you appear for this examination explore microsoft azure once you do that brush up your networking skills brush up your programming skills understand how powershell works how cli works how vms work and then start with the syllabus for the examination guys if you devote or dedicate somewhere around three to four months very loyally at least three to four hours every day three hours maybe you would be in a very good position to go ahead and crack this particular certification examination and again focus on microsoft stack of software's meannet framework which is very important for any azure certification examination guys having said that guys now what i'm going to do is i'm quickly going to switch into my console or my browser because i want to walk you through certain important pointers as well so guys i've actually gone ahead and switched into my browser so this is the page i wanted to show to you people as you can see this is the certification that i wanted to talk about so you can see the fees here is 165 dollars which i've already mentioned so one thing that i missed out on was what if you are from a different region you can come here and you can select that region and see the price changing so since i am in india probably we have the prices in indian currency for that i would have to scroll up So yes guys this is how the new certifications are and this is what azure has done again if you're looking for structure training approach this would be a good option edureka has recently launched their ac 100 200 and 300 certifications and those are very specific to the content that we've discussed till time now if you take a look at the content here the topics that are covered here are very much specific to the certification and very much in line with the certification you can see it here these are the topics that were mentioned in the discussion we had it is very much in line with the certification examination so if you take this course you would be very well prepared for your examination and again you would get a very good hands-on on microsoft azure if you take a look at the fees here it is very less 17 000 inr again the fees here is real time it changes when i say changes i mean if you are a customer and you stay tuned with our channel you probably might get more offers and probably might get extra discount as well so stay tuned for that as well if you talk about the features of this certification they're fairly good guys you can take a look at those here all the details are your projects and stuff like that if you come here you have these features that is your support you have real life case studies you'd be working on you have recorded sessions and lifetime access to the resources that you actually get while taking this course it is your decision guys it was just a suggestion as far as this particular session goes i wanted to focus on microsoft azure. So this is the breakdown guys i was talking about at the start of the session az101 are these certifications that probably cover most of the content from azure 533 certification that is 7533 which is the administrative exam certification see what they've done is they've broken it down into two parts this is azure infrastructure and deployment specifically which we talked about if you take a step further once you clear this certification you can take this one as well microsoft azure integration and security is the other one so it focuses on something else so you can see that the content is divided and intent is role specific.
