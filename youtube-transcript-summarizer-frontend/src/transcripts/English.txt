 Called scrub so scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value now you need to understand three things about scrum firstly scrum is lightweight second it is simple to understand and third it is very difficult to master scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration based on agile and it is the opposite of a big collection of interwoven mandatory components which are a part of the previously discussed waterfall alternative now scrum promotes developing products through processes techniques and practices with various iterations and increments to deliver maximum value as i had mentioned before so that way the first cycle of your planning building testing previewing shall be called your first iteration the second one will be your second iteration the third time you plan build test and review will be a third iteration followed by the fourth and finally the fifth now these items are called strengths and at the end of each sprint you have the launch of a potentially deliverable software each software version much better than the previous one each sprint takes up about one to four weeks and you keep repeating these sprint's until your product is feature complete sometimes you might even end up shipping your product after just the second sprint but sometimes it may also take three four or five or even more sprints but at the end of it you have a good product and that is what matters now scrum follows an agile approach to tackle complex problems now agile is not a methodology or framework or process now eagle promotes self learning and self-organization as opposed to a lot of planning and a big collection of interwoven mandatory components it implements a scientific method which replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a more heuristic one with respect for people and self-organization to deal with the unpredictability of complain problems this approach basically means not planning the whole entire process to create a potentially shippable product but to only plan enough to start out with and then react to the responses that you get with each sprint or each iteration now there are three rules and scrub first of all you have the person with the bright ideas who is the product owner next you have the scrum master who is the one basically implementing agile and preparing the team to follow the agile approach and making them more efficient and finally you have the team mostly the team consists of developers testers writers it can be anything each of them can be replaceable by either one of them so on certain days you might find that developers are testing testers are writing so on and so forth the main objective here is to create the product in the best possible way there are a lot of reversible roles that are being played in the team now to make you understand the approach of the scrum master or the agile approach let me take a problem statement so take for example there are a number of people in the room and they have to queue up according to their respective heights taking as less time as possible so that these many people in the room now to this problem there can be two solutions first of all we have the supervisor approach here we have a traditional supervisor or a manager and basically what they do is they arrange people one by one taking up the time for each person to align themselves which basically takes up a lot of time and also as a team you learn nothing about organization      .
